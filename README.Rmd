# compmap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of compmap is to download maps of countries from the [gadm](https://gadm.org) database (using the `raster` package) and then use `rmapshaper` functions to compress the file size as desired. 

## Installation

``` {r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("flee598/compmap")
```

## Example
Download a map of New Zealand and reduce the file size (this reduces the original map from ~24 Mb to ~500 kb).
```{r eval = F}
library(compmap)
library(ggplot2)

nz <- fun_get_map(cntry = "NZ", kp = 0.03, min_area = 1000)

# plot the resulting map
ggplot(nz) +
  geom_sf()
```
